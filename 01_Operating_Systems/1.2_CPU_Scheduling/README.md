# 1.2 CPU Scheduling

## CPU Scheduler Concepts
- **Ready Queue**
  - Queue management
  - Process selection
  
- **Context Switching**
  - Context switching overhead
  - State saving/restoring
  
- **Scheduling Types**
  - Preemptive scheduling
  - Non-preemptive scheduling

## Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come First Served)**
  - Non-preemptive
  - Simple implementation
  - Convoy effect
  
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
  - Non-preemptive
  - Optimal average waiting time
  - Prediction challenges
  
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**
  - Preemptive version of SJF
  - Context switching overhead
  
- **Round Robin**
  - Preemptive
  - Time quantum
  - Fair CPU distribution
  
- **Priority Scheduling**
  - Static vs Dynamic priority
  - Priority inversion
  - Starvation problem
  
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue**
  - Multiple queues
  - Aging mechanism
  - Flexible scheduling

## Scheduling Metrics
- **Turnaround Time**
  - Completion time - Arrival time
  - Overall performance measure
  
- **Waiting Time**
  - Time spent in ready queue
  - Scheduler efficiency
  
- **Response Time**
  - First response - Arrival time
  - Interactive system metric
