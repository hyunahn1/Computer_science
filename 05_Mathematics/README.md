# Mathematics for Computer Science

## Overview
Mathematical foundations essential for computer science, from discrete mathematics and cryptography to linear algebra, calculus, and probability. These concepts underpin algorithms, graphics, robotics, machine learning, and systems engineering.

**Philosophy**: Mathematics is a tool for modeling and optimizing real-world problems. Even non-math backgrounds can master these concepts with practice.
