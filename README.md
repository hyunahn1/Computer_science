# Computer Science Study Repository

A comprehensive repository for organizing computer science knowledge, study materials, and resources.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into five main areas of computer science:

### 1. [Operating Systems](./01_Operating_Systems/)
Study materials covering process management, memory management, file systems, synchronization, deadlock, I/O systems, and Linux kernel fundamentals.

### 2. [Computer Architecture & Embedded Hardware](./02_Computer_Architecture/)
Resources for understanding CPU architecture, digital logic, microcontroller peripherals, RTOS, and embedded systems development including build tools and debugging.

### 3. [Data Structures & Algorithms](./03_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/)
Implementation and analysis of fundamental data structures (arrays, lists, trees, graphs, heaps) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, bit manipulation).

### 4. [Computer Networks](./04_Networks/)
Computer networking concepts covering OSI/TCP-IP models, protocols at each layer, IP addressing and routing, TCP/UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, and network security fundamentals.

### 5. [Mathematics for Computer Science](./05_Mathematics/)
Mathematical foundations including discrete mathematics, number theory and cryptography, linear algebra, calculus and numerical methods, probability and statistics.

## Directory Structure

Each main topic follows a consistent structure:

```
Topic_Name/
├── README.md       # Overview and topic guide
├── notes/          # Study notes and summaries
├── resources/      # Books, papers, and reference materials
├── exercises/      # Practice problems and solutions
└── projects/       # Implementation projects and assignments
```
